The oscboard is a virtual lighting controller.

It loads a yaml based configuration describing the layout of the
control elements and what endpoints to connect them to.

Configuration format:
  title: <window title> (optional)
  widget: <main widget>

A widget is described by a mapping of the form:
  type: <type of widget>
  name: <label to display>  (control only)
  osc: <url of endpoint>    (control only)
  childs: <list of widgets> (container only)

Currently supported widget types are containers (hbox,vbox) and
control elements (hscale, vscale, colorsel).

hscale and vscale will send one int between 0 and 255 to the given
endpoint when they are changed.

colorsel will send three ints between 0 and 255 to the given endpoint,
representing rgb values.

See sublab.board for a simple example.
